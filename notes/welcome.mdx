## Hey Developer

If you've been sent here by the [Fountane](https://fountane.com) Team, then
firstly, **A huge welcome to the team!** If not, that's fine, you can still read this, I grant you the needed permissions.

The handbook is based off of learnings and changes in process that I've
implemented in my own development workflow over the years and is what I wish
to share with you so we can maintain consistency while working together.
